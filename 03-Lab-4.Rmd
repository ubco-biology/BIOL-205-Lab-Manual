# Applying Open Science Principles {-}

You will be expected to apply some principles of <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Open-science">Open Science</a> to your research project. For a brief refresher on Open Science Principles and the Research Workflow see the following links:

* [Open Science & Registered Reports](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-116-Lab-Manual/open-science.htmlhttps://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-116-Lab-Manual/open-science.html)
* [The Research Workflow](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-116-Lab-Manual/the-research-workflow.html)

For this project, you will follow the stages of a typical <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Registered-report">registered report</a> and implement the following Open Science practices while working on your project:

* Using appropriate <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Version-control">version control</a> on electronic documents and proper <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#File-and-data-management">file and data management</a> practices throughout the experiment. 
    * Be sure to follow the rules outlined in Chapters 1-5 [File and Data Management](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/file-and-data-management.html) in the UBCO Biology Procedures & Guidelines Document.
* Performing a <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Literature-review">literature review</a> on your research topic and documenting a list of consulted studies, how they were found, and the strengths, limitations, and weaknesses of each.
* Submitting a research proposal draft with an established <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#A-priori-hypothesis">a priori hypothesis</a>, experimental design, and plan for presenting and analyzing your data. This will be marked before the experiment implementation phase and TA feedback incorporated into the project as needed. Creating a detailed, thorough plan for your research often takes as much time as running the experiment and collecting and analyzing your data. The more you plan, including anticipating potential problems, the easier the implementation!
* Implementing the study according to your plan, and noting any deviations from that plan (Note: deviations often happen, and that's OK! The key is to document them). These reflections will be submitted for marks.
* Submitting and presenting a poster that details your experiences implementing the research plan (including any changes recorded, justification for changes, <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Statistical-analysis">analysis</a> of the data, and your interpretation and conclusion).

# Assignment 3: Research Proposal Draft {-}

**Due before the start of your lab the week of February 7th** 

You were introduced to Scientific Writing, RMarkdown, and RStudio when you completed a Recommendation Report in BIOL 125. We will be using the same format and template for the Research Proposal in BIOL 205. Follow the steps below to get started on your assignment:

1. Read all of the subsections under the [Recommendation Report](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-125-Lab-Manual/recommendation-report.html) heading of the BIOL 125 lab manual
2. Download the template for the assignment
    a. You will use the RMarkdown template provided in BIOL 125 for this research proposal. The template and instructions for how to use the template can be found [here](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-125-Lab-Manual/assignment-lab-5.html).

<div class = "note">
Since you are completing a research proposal and not writing up the results of a research project, **remove the results section**. 

The discussion section of your report can focus on the **implications of your proposed project** rather than interpretation of results and client recommendations.
</div>

**Ideas on Preparing a Research Proposal**

*	Read a lot!  It is important that you have a thorough understanding of the topic.  At the very least you should have at least 3 primary source papers you are referring too throughout your proposal.
*	Discuss your ideas with other students (not just your partner).  Get a feel for what everyone else is doing and the depth they are working in.
*	Start writing early!  Students often make the mistake of starting the night before the proposal is due.  This more than not results in poor submissions and thus lower grades.  You should expect that you will have at least 3 rounds of revisions before you submit.
*	Someone reading your proposal should be able to tell what question(s) you will address, why the topic is interesting and/or important, how you will approach the problem, the types of data you will collect, and how your research will advance the field.

As you work on the draft of your research proposal, be sure to consult the Final Research Proposal marking rubric [here](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-205-Lab-Manual/research-proposal-rubric.html)!
