For the data <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Statistical-analysis">analysis</a> portion of your presentation, you will use the `R` scripts given to you earlier in the semester. The `R` scripts, along with instructions on how to use them, can be found by clicking on the following link: [BIOL205 RScripts](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-205-Lab-Manual/using-the-rscripts.html)

There is no assignment due for this module. However, you should speak with your TA to discuss the statistical options you plan to pursue. Statistical analyses can be challenging, and speaking with your TA will help give them an opportunity to guide you and ensure you are appropriately analyzing your data. Using the correct type of analysis will be key to having a great presentation.
