Some phytoplankton species, however, produce toxins. These toxin producing algae are becoming more common and showing up in more places worldwide. Some of these toxins will produce neurotoxins that prevent nerve transmission signals, resulting in negative effects in animals that consume it. Toxins from phytoplankton can be transferred through the food web and accumulate in higher trophic levels, causing mortality in shellfish, fish, sea birds, and humans. Humans that eat contaminated shellfish can become sick and die. A major challenge for aquatic scientists and environmental managers is to predict the response of animal populations to the proliferation of toxic phytoplankton. A great deal of scientific effort is spent trying to understand the population dynamics of toxic algal blooms and their effects on the food web. Figure 1. Simplified marine food web, including toxic phytoplankton A vital link between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels is provided by copepods, a type of zooplankton. Zooplankton are animal-like plankton that need to ingest other organisms to survive. Copepods are estimated to be the most abundant animals on the planet and are the main food source for many larval fish species. This leads to the refrain: no copepods no fish. Figure 2. The copepod Acartia hudsonicaand a toxic phytoplankton cell, Alexandrium fundysense. The toxic dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium spp. Often blooms from Long Island Sound in the United Sates, to the Bay of Fundy, Canada (Figure 3). This bloom results in negative effects in animals (grazers) that consume it and these toxins can accumulate in the higher trophic levels, causing mortality in fish, sea birds and humans. In order to better predict the response of animal populations to the proliferation of toxic phytoplankton, Alexandrium fundysense, scientist studied the populations of the copepod Acartia hudsonica found in two different regions of the distribution from the Bay of Fundy, Canada, to about Long Island sound, New York and Connecticut. There are frequent and high toxicity levels in the norther region of this range (e.g., Maine) and no toxic blooms recorded in the southern regions (e.g., New Jersey). Figure 3. Geographical distribution of toxic Alexandrium spp. The frequency and toxicity of Alexandrium decreases from north to south. The copepod Acartia hudsonica, a main grazer of toxic Alexandrium, is found throughout the entire range shown. Stars correspond to population origins from experiments described here. Northern star indicates Maine, southern star indicates New Jersey sampling sites. Scientist discovered that at maximum ingestion rates the Maine population had higher egg production compared to the New Jersey population (Figure 4) however when copepods were ingesting non-toxic phytoplankton there were no differences in egg production between these populations (Figure 5). Figure 4. Ingestion rate (feeding; left) and egg production rate (reproduction; right) for copepods feeding on a diet containing toxic Alexandrium spp. Ingestion rates were measured over a range of food concentrations while egg production rates correspond to a single concentration. Food saturation occurs around 500 µgCL-1; this means that this concentration represents maximum ingestion and egg production. Scientist chose this concentration for egg production because this is where the greatest difference, if any, in ingestion rate occurred. The Maine population (red) had statistically higher ingestion and egg production rate compared to copepods from New Jersey (green). Units for the dependent variable are in micrograms of carbon (µgC; food) and per copepod per day (ingestion and egg production). Error bars represent standard deviation among replicates in egg production; they are omitted for clarity from ingestion rates. Data adapted from Colin and Dam (2007, 2004). Figure 5. Ingestion rate (feeding; left) and egg production rate (reproduction; right) for copepods feeding on a n o-toxic diet. Ingestion rates were measured over a range of food concentrations while egg production rates correspond to a single concentration. Food saturation occurs around 500µgCL-1; this mean as that this concentration represents maximum ingestion and egg production. There were no differences between the Maine (red) and New Jersey (green) populations for both ingestion and egg production rate compared. That is, the two populations fed and reproduced at the same rate. Units and errors bars are the same as Figure 1. Data adapted from Colin and Dam (2007, 2004). There is still much to learn about the fecundity, mortality and growth of copepods in response to toxic algae. Scientist need to better understand the interaction between toxic algae and their grazers and the adaptability of copepods to toxic algae. Understanding these relationships is key to being able to predict and mitigate issues surrounding fish populations. Your Role You have been hired by National Freshwater Copepod Conservation and Fish Restoration agency (NFCCFR) to investigate the impacts of toxic algae on copepod populations. The NFCCFR is interested to know what negative effects, if any, can toxic algae produce in the copepod population in freshwater populations. Due to budget constraints you and your partner will need to conduct this research in lab and provide the NFCCFR with a proposal for approval prior to initiating your research. (The NFCCFR is your TA in case you were wondering). Before you can begin developing your proposal you must first become immersed in your topic. You and your partner will need to source out 5 primary source papers related to this topic. "],["macroinvertebrates-project.html", "Macroinvertebrates Project", " Macroinvertebrates Project Potential changes in macroinvertebrates: Mitigation recommendations needed In Lannisport, a major town located in the city of Westeros, water sampling has been conducted by the Friends of the Turkey River Organization every three weeks from January to June in order to monitor the impacts of the Milford Farm on the Turkey River (Fig. 6). Figure 6. Map of Milford Farm along the Turkey River There is growing concern that the levels in glyphosate and/or bacteria levels may impact the macroinvertebrate population found in the Turkey river. Data shown below on glyphosate levels (Fig. 2) and fecal bacterial levels (Fig. 3) have been collected every three weeks by a water quality sampling team. Figure 7. Glyphosate levels found both upstream and downstream from farm on the Milford property taken every three weeks. Figure 8. Number of fecal coliform bacterial levels per 100 ml sample upstream and downstream the farm on the Milford property taken every 3 weeks. There is serious concern about the impacts of the farm to the water quality of the creek. The growing concern is whether or not these changes in glyphosate or bacteria levels will result in changes to the macroinvertebrate population and thus the trout population. Both macroinvertebrates and fish populations are used to assess river health however as macroinvertebrate populations are a large source for many animals in this ecological system, the Friends of the Mission Creek (FMCO) and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) are currently interested in looking at macroinvertebrates specifically. Your Role You have been hired by the Friends of the Mission Creek Organization (FMCO) and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) to investigate how this happened, what the possible effects are on the aquatic life and what can be done to prevent it from happening again.

"],["invasive-mussles-project.html", "Invasive Mussles Project", " Invasive Mussles Project Invasive Mussel Project – Mitigation Recommendations Needed Both the zebra and quagga mussels have been shown to be extremely destructive in the Great Lakes (NOAA, 2008). Originally from Eastern Europe they were introduced here in Canada through ballast water discharge from ships, first the zebra mussels in the 80’s and then the quaggas in the 90’s. As of late it appears the quagga mussels can outcompete the zebra mussels due to their ability to tolerate colder temperatures, live I soft sediment and have a much longer siphon for feeding. The NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) have been monitoring the issue since the arrival of the quaggas. The map below (Fig. 1) illustrate how quickly the quaggas have dominated the area. Figure 9. Density of Quagga Mussels in Lake Michigan determined in the year 2000, 2005 and 2010 (NOAA, 2008) Food production for native species have been declining since the introduction of these invasive mussels and in particular the shrimp-like organisms called Diporeia as shown in the Figure 1. Figure 10. Density of Diporeia in Lake Michigan in 1994/1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 (NOAA, 2008) Along with increased mussels and decreased Diporeia researchers have seen an increase in the size and number of harmful bottom-dwelling alga in the Great Lakes. One such algal is called Cladophora, which makes its way on to beaches in clumps rendering the beaches unpleasant due to their unsightly and smelly nature and also impact nutrient levels in the water (NOAA, 2008). Figure 11. Phytoplankton production from 1983 to 2008 in the springtime in southern Lake Michigan (NOAA, 2008).) The decline in Diporiea has resulted in some fish changing diet to a less nutrient rich diet in order to survive. As recreational fishing has a huge presence in the Great Lakes the presence of these invasive mussels has taken its toll on the economy (NOAA, 2008). Alongside this, the tourism industry has been impacted due to the less enticing beach quality that has resulted from the Cladophoral blooms (NOAA, 2008). Consequently, the GLERL has hired you to further investigate why and how this relationship is taking place in order to determine what mitigation strategies may be implemented. Your Role You have been hired by the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) to investigate the relationship seen between invasive mussels and the harmful algal blooms.

We will be using a similar format and template for your 3rd and 4th assignments in BIOL 205. Protocols are frequently not formally peer-reviewed. However, there is a specific publication type known as a Registered Report, in which peer-review of a protocol is an integral part. In a Registered Report, you submit a protocol with a detailed study design and plan, which is then reviewed by an editorial board, often suggestions for improvement are made, and if accepted on re-submission, the journal, within reason, commits to publishing your study irrespective of whether your findings are statistically significant. Following on this model, Assignment 3 will be your detailed study design plan. Your TA will be your peer reviewer as they grade your submission. Assignment 4 will be your re-submission of your study design based on feedback from your TA. This will be followed by your final in class presentation of the results of your proposed study! To prepare you for this, we’ll start with a short review of materials related to Open Science, R, &amp; RMarkdown from BIOL 125. After reviewing this material, you should be set to draft your protocol using an RMarkdown template. "],["overview-1.html", "Overview", " Overview Open Science Open Science is a movement that tries to combat the replication crisis, questionable research practices, and flashy research trumping quality research in two ways. First, by providing different incentives and rewards for research. That is, changing what we measure as a success in research, shifting from a culture that emphasizes novel findings to one that also rewards the many other aspects of practicing good science. Second, by making all parts of the scientific research process transparent and accessible, allowing for a critical review of how a study was conducted, and ultimately enabling that study to be independently replicated. For an optional refresher of Open Science principles and core values, visit the Open Science 101 Module that was covered in BIOL 116. Registered Reports A Registered Report involves submitting–in the form of a protocol–your research question, hypotheses, and planned methods, for peer review prior to beginning data collection. Using this format enhances research quality because it gives researchers a chance alter study design and methods before investing time into data collection. Just think of a time where you spent countless hours writing an essay thinking it was perfect, only to give it to a friend to read and receive a ton of editing comments. Often readers notice things the author doesn’t! This approach also helps avoid questionable research practices like selective reporting of results and publication bias. The protocol that you submit for peer review will include: Performing a literature review on your research topic and documenting a list of consulted studies, how they were found, and the strengths, limitations, and weaknesses of each. Submitting a a priori hypothesis, experimental design, and plan for presenting and analyzing your data. This will be marked before the experiment implementation phase and TA feedback incorporated into the project as needed. Creating a detailed, thorough plan for your research often takes as much time as running the experiment and collecting and analyzing your data. The more you plan, including anticipating potential problems, the easier the implementation! Implementing the study according to your plan, and noting any deviations from that plan (Note: deviations often happen, and that’s OK! The key is to document them). These reflections will be submitted for marks. Submitting and presenting the details of your experiences implementing the research plan (including any changes recorded, justification for changes, analysis of the data, and your interpretation and conclusion). It is expected throughout this process that you will be implementing best practices for research data management as articulate in the UBCO Procedures and Guidelines, including using appropriate version control on electronic documents and proper file and data management practices throughout your experiment. Need a refresher? Revisit the rules outlined in Chapters 1-5 File and Data Management in the Procedures &amp; Guidelines. Why Use R &amp; RMarkdown? While there are numerous programs that you can use to write lab reports, research manuscripts, and perform statistical analysis, there are so many benefits to using R &amp; RMarkdown! First, R is both free and open source! Moreover, using R allows for computational reproducibility of your work. Computational reproducibility is the ability to document data and analyses so that others can understand and replicate the computations that led to the results and conclusions. While you could use R to perform statistical analyses and write your report separately using a program like Microsoft Word. By using RMarkdown to write your lab report, you can include data analyses directly within the report which allows for everything to be stored in a single document. This makes it simple for readers to understand the computations used to conduct analyses as they read through your paper. For your Registered Report in BIOL 205 you won’t be expected to have the code for your analyses directly embedded within your RMarkdown document but you will use pre-made R scripts to perform these analyses. Accessibility is a key aspect of Open Science. And while digital accessibility has many connotations, one of these relates to cost. R has no associated financial costs with it and RStudio supports free distribution of their software for educational use. The same can’t be said for many alternative authoring and statistical programs, for example products from Microsoft. Scientific Writing, Installation of R &amp; RStudio For a refresher on scientific writing, the different sections of a lab report, and setting up R &amp; RStudio, see the BIOL 125 Lab Manual here https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-125-Lab-Manual/recommendation-report.html. Read all of the subsections under the Recommendation Report. "],["assignment-template.html", "Assignment Template", " Assignment Template You will use the following template for your protocol: BIOL205_Lab03_Assignment3.Rmd Before starting your protocol, we’ll spend some time reviewing the different parts of this template. Using the Template All the markdown syntax that you need for RMarkdown can be found in the Markdown section of the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines. Directory Structure &amp; File Naming It is expected that you will have a root project folder for your work associated with this lab. And that at the minimum you will have a folder for your report, your data, your figures, and your scripts. And that you will download this template into your report/ directory. And that lastly, you will rename the template in accordance with the file naming conventions in the Biology Procedures and Guidelines document. Lastly, we’ll be working with an RProject file this round to help ensure our project’s working directory is properly set up in R. It's important to load your project using the RProject file and not the RMarkdown file to ensure your working directory is properly set and that all the scripts and templates we’ll be using work as intended! Review the instruction here in the Procedures and Guidelines Document, for setting up a working directory and RProject file. Your project directory structure should look something like this once you’ve created your RProject file and you’ve downloaded a copy of the RMarkdown file: ├── BIOL205_RP/ │ ├── BIOL205_report.RProj │ ├── data/ │ ├── figures/ │ ├── report/ │ │ ├── 20220101_Lab03_205_Assignment_V1.Rmd │ ├── scripts/ YAML The top of the template contains some front matter called YAML. YAML provides instructions to all the pieces of software involved in converting your RMarkdown document to it's outputs, in this case, pdf. YAML is very specific to spacing, so don't add any extra spaces! What you need to do. Provide a title within the quotations after title. Provide your name within the quotations after author. Provide your abstract within the quotations after abstract. What might be nice to know. r Sys.Date() pulls the date from your computer and auto populates this for you. The output tag defines the output format. Other options include html_document and word_document. What exactly is YAML? YAML™ (rhymes with “camel”) is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data serialization language designed around the common native data types of dynamic programming languages. It is broadly useful for programming needs ranging from configuration files to internet messaging to object persistence to data auditing and visualization. Read more at the Official YAML Web Site Document Body The template is then pre-populated with first level headers for each section you're expected to include in your report. Each heading re-iterates the key elements the content of these headings should address. This is just place holder text, so replace it with your own. Images &amp; Graphs There is one sample graph referenced in the template. If you'd like to download this image and place it in your figures/ directory to test knitting your template, the file can be downloaded at this link. And your project should look like this: ├── BIOL205_RP/ │ ├── BIOL205_report.RProj │ ├── data/ │ ├── figures/ │ │ ├── MVD_BIOL125-Lab5_Fig-1-Boxplot_V1.png │ ├── report/ │ │ ├── 20220101_Lab03_205_Assignment_V1.Rmd │ ├── scripts/ You might note the following directly after the image path: {width=50%}. This reduces the image size by 50%. As noted in the template, you do not need to write Figure 1: before your figures; this small piece of text is handled during the conversion from RMarkdown to pdf. Any other information that you would like to include in the caption should go in the [] before the () that contain the path to the image. Figure placement The engine behind the conversion from RMarkdown to pdf is a typesetting application, one with pretty strict rules about how content should be formatted - much more strict than something like Microsoft Word. What this means is that if the placement of your images will disrupt your prose - by creating large amounts of empty white space for example - this typesetting application will push your figure to somewhere lower in your report where it won't create this white space. Your figures should be adjacent to the relevant text in your RMarkdown file. How this manifests to your pdf might look a little different; that's ok. References Just before the heading for references you'll see the following \\clearpage This creates a page break between your references section and the rest of your report. Building the pdf If you’ve installed R, RStudio, and the markdown and tinytex packages succesfully, when you open the template .Rmd file you should see an option to Knit. Click this button or select the drop down arrow and select Knit to pdf. This will generate a pdf in the same directory as your .Rmd file.

For this assignment you will submit a protocol with an established a priori hypothesis, experimental design, and plan for presenting and analyzing your data. This will be marked before the experiment implementation phase and TA feedback incorporated into the project as needed. Creating a detailed, thorough plan for your research often takes as much time as running the experiment and collecting and analyzing your data. The more you plan, including anticipating potential problems, the easier the implementation! Your protocol will be comprised of the following sections: Abstract Data availability Introduction Methods Discussion - describe the potential implications of your project References Protocols don’t often have an abstract. But being able to write a concise synopsis of what’s to come is a critical skill in academic writing. So we’re going to take advantage of the opportunity to practice by requiring one for this assignment! Your data availability statement should be a proposed statement. Something like ‘Data will be made available…’. You will receive your marked protocol one week from the time it is submitted. If you have any questions regarding your mark and / or the comments from your TA please ensure you take the opportunity to chat with your TA to go over these. This will ensure that you are in the best position to attain the highest marks possible for this assignment. Tips for Preparing a Protocol Read a lot! It is important that you have a thorough understanding of the topic. At the very least you should have at least 3 primary source papers you are referring too throughout your report. Discuss your ideas with other students (not just your partner). Get a feel for what everyone else is doing and the depth they are working in. Start writing early! Students often make the mistake of starting the night before the report is due. This more than not results in poor submissions and thus lower grades. You should expect that you will have at least 3 rounds of revisions before you submit. Someone reading your report should be able to tell what question(s) you will address, why the topic is interesting and/or important, how you will approach the problem, the types of data you will collect, and how your research will advance the field.

Both response and explanatory variables are categorical BIOL205_Script_Categorical-Categorical.R Both response and explanatory variables are quantitative BIOL205_Script_Quantitative-Quantitative.R Categorical explanatory variable and quantitative response variable BIOL205_Script_Quantitative-Categorical.R While there are instructions within the R scripts themselves, the following sections describe how to use the R scripts in more detail. Be sure to read everything here and in the R scripts! Alongside each line of code in the script is a comment proceeded with a hash tag (#). The comments are either descriptions of what the code is doing or instructions describing things you need to do. You must correctly set up your project and working directory using the instructions below for this to work. You must also not simply open your R script, but instead launch your RProject file and then from within RStudio load the script from the built in file manager. The general workflow here is: Launch RStudio using your RPoject file Load your data Provide the script with your variable names and the labels you’d like to use on your graphs Generate a graph; the script will save these to your figures/ directory Run your descriptive stats; the script will save these to your report/ directory where you can copy the relevant information to your RMarkdown file Run you statistical analyses; the script will save these to your report/ directory where you can copy the relevant information to your RMarkdown file If you quite RStudio, you will need to re-run steps 1-3 to do any of steps 4-6 again. Step 1: Set your working directory If you haven’t already, make sure your working directory is set according to the instructions here in the Procedures and Guidelines Document. Your directory should look something like this when you’re done, that is, after downloading at least one script, ensuring your data is in the project’s data folder, you’ve created an RMarkdown file, you’ve generated an RPoject file and put everything in its respective directory. Don’t worry if you don’t have all these things ready yet, just make sure that when you’re ready to run your scripts with your data, this is the model you’re working with. ├── BIOL205_RP/ │ ├── BIOL205_report.RProj │ ├── data/ │ │ ├── 20221023_sample-data.csv │ ├── figures/ │ ├── report/ │ │ ├── 20220101_Lab03_205_Assignment_V1.Rmd │ ├── scripts/ │ │ ├── BIOL205_Script_Quantitative-Categorical.R Step 2: Installing &amp; Loading Required Packages We’ll be using a couple of features that are not part of the basic install of R in our scripts. We add additional features in R with packages. Packages in R contain a set of functions, code, and data that you can use for your analysis. Before you can use the functions within a package, the package must be both installed in R, which we do once, and loaded into R, which we do each time we start the application. While packages only need to be installed once, if you're on a lab computer, since the computers are re-set at the end of each day you may need to re-install packages at each log in. To install packages noted in the R script, copy the installation lines of code without the preceding hashtag (#) ie. remove the # from # install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) so it looks like this install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) and copy it into the R console (lower left pane of RStudio). When you hit enter on your keyboard the package will install. Be sure to do this for all of the required packages noted in the R script; these are in the first few lines of each script. Once packages are installed, they must be loaded to your current session. You will have to do this each time you re-start R. To load packages use the library() function by running the lines of code pre-written into your R script. For example, run library(ggplot2) by placing your cursor in that line of code and clicking the ‘Run’ button at the top right of the working document. To load all packages at the same time, use your cursor to highlight all of the sections of code you want to run (lines 35-38 in the screenshot below), and then click ‘run’. Running code can be done several ways in RStudio. You can go through line by line, putting you cursor in the line you wish to run, and executing each independently of the next. Or you can run a section of code by highlighting the ‘chunk’ you want to run. The scripts are broken into ‘steps’. It’s probably best to highlight whole sections of each step and then running that chunk. But if you’d like to run line by line to get a better sense of what’s happening, go for it! To quickly run a line of code, place your cursor on the line and use ctrl + Enter or Command + Enter if you’re on a Mac. Step 3: Uploading your data Replace the content within the quotes that read ‘insert-data-file-name-here.csv’ with the file name that your data is saved as to your computer. This will be in between lines 45 and 50 depending on the script you’re using. If my data file was called 20221023_sample-data.csv, I’d change the following line my_file &lt;- paste0(dir,&quot;insert-data-file-name-here.csv&quot;) # assign file name to a variable to my_file &lt;- paste0(dir,&quot;20221023_sample-data.csv&quot;) # assign file name to a variable If your data file contains a header row, be sure that the following line, which reads my_data &lt;- read.csv(file = my_file, header = TRUE) shows header = TRUE. If you have no header row, simply change the code to header = FALSE. Step 4: Visualizing your data You'll need to tell R some information before you can create graphs or do analyses. Specifically, you need to assign the names of your variables and axis labels. You can do this by Replacing “X variable name” and “Y variable name” with the names of your x and y variables Replacing “X label name” and “Y label name” with your desired x and y axes labels So, we update the following lines x_var &lt;- &quot;X variable name&quot; # Replace with the name of your x variable x_label &lt;- &quot;X label name&quot; # Replace with your desired x axis label y_var &lt;- &quot;Y variable name&quot; # Replace with the name of your x variable y_label &lt;- &quot;Y label name&quot; # Replace with your desired y axis label with something like x_var &lt;- &quot;ht&quot; # Replace with the name of your x variable x_label &lt;- &quot;Height (in cm)&quot; # Replace with your desired x axis label y_var &lt;- &quot;day&quot; # Replace with the name of your x variable y_label &lt;- &quot;Day&quot; # Replace with your desired y axis label R is case sensitive. When providing your variable names, make sure they match exactly the variables used in your csv file! In the R script for a categorical explanatory and a categorical response variable, code for both a boxplot and a stripchart is included. Recall that according to the Biology Procedures and Guidelines document, you should use a boxplot if the groups of your categorical variable have more than 20 data points. Alternatively, you should use a stripchart if each group contains less than 20 data points. Be sure to only produce one desired figure. In some of the R scripts there are some additional pieces of code that you don’t need to worry about for now; you’ll learn more about these in BIOL 202! For example, we have to factor the categorical variables before producing graphs. You will see this additional code if the script you are using includes categorical variables. In the code for creating a boxplot or stripchart, we refer to a function that calculates confidence intervals. So we have to define that function prior to running the code to produce the figure. You will find this additional piece of code in your R script if your experiment has a categorical explanatory variable and quantitative response variable. There are some regions in the R scripts where variables are re-named or manipulated. If your up for it, take some time to read through the script and see if you can figure out exactly what’s happening! Now you’re ready to run the code to create your figures and statistical calculations! Remember, once the code has been run, your figures will show in the lower right panel of RStudio under ‘Plots’ as well as being exported as .png image to your figures/ directory, and the results of your statistical analyses will be displayed in your R console, the lower left panel, as well as being saved as either .csv or .txt to your reports/ directory. Step 5: Calculate descriptive statistics The code here should run smoothly if everything in the proceeding steps was done correctly. Once the code has been run, your descriptive statistics will be printed in the console of RStudio (lower left panel). The instructions below describe how to interpret this output depending on the types of variables in your experiment. Two Categorical Variables Here is an example of the descriptive statistics output produced by the R script for two categorical variables. The explanatory (independent) variable and its associated groups appear in the first column, while the response (dependent) variable appears at the top. In this case the explanatory variable was species and the response variable was sex. The numbers provided in the table describe the frequency for each category. For example, in this sample there was 1 female Adelie penguin and 0 male Chinstrap penguins. ## sex ## species female male ## Adelie 73 73 ## Chinstrap 34 34 ## Gentoo 58 61 Two Quantitative Variables Here is an example of the output produced by the R script for two quantitative variables. The explanatory (independent) variable appears in the first row, while the response (dependent) variable appears in the second row. n indicates the sample size, while the following columns represent the mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile range, respectively. ## n mean sd median iqr ## bill_length_mm 344 43.9 5.46 NA 9.27 ## bill_depth_mm 344 17.2 1.97 NA 3.10 One Categorical and One Quantitative Variable Here is an example of the output produced by the R script for one categorical and one quantitative variable. This table is organized so that the descriptive statistics of the quantitative response variable are reported based on the groups of the explanatory variable. n indicates the sample size, while the following columns represent the mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile range, respectively. For example, the mean mass (g) for Adelie penguins in this sample is 3775 g. ## species n mean sd median iqr ## 1 Adelie 152 3700.7 458.57 3700 650.0 ## 2 Chinstrap 68 3733.1 384.34 3700 462.5 ## 3 Gentoo 124 5076.0 504.12 5000 800.0 Take a screenshot of these values or write them down for writing your lab report later. Step 6: Performing statistical analyses Similar to with the descriptive statistics, the code here should run smoothly if everything in the proceeding steps was done correctly. The type of statistical analyses you will perform depends on the types of variables in your experiment. Code for all possible statistical tests is included within the R scripts. Only run the code that corresponds with the type of variables in your experiment. Use the guidelines below to help you choose the appropriate statistical test. Both response (dependent) and explanatory (independent) variables are categorical Both your response and explanatory variables have exactly 2 groups -&gt; Use Fisher’s Exact Test At least one of your response or explanatory variables has more than 2 groups -&gt; Use Chi-Square Contingency Analysis Both response (dependent) and explanatory (independent) variables are quantitative Use Correlation Analysis Response (dependent) variable is quantitative and explanatory (independent) variable is categorical Your categorical variable has exactly 2 groups -&gt; Use Two Sample T-test Your categorical variable has more than 2 groups -&gt; Use ANOVA When interpreting the output from a statistical analysis for this project, focus on the p-value provided by R. You’ll learn more about the other details shown by the output in BIOL 202! Below are some examples of output for each type of statistical test.

Now that you have developed a thorough understanding of the topic you will need to present your findings and provide some potential solutions to the original problem to your funders, which in this case are your peers. All groups will give oral presentations in your regular lab period during the last week of term. Each group will have 10 minutes for their talk followed by a couple of minutes for questions. This is typically the time period allowed at a scientific conference. Each student in the group should participate equally in the presentation. Your presentation must be done using PowerPoint. A computer and projector will be available in the lab. Bring your presentation on a usb. You are also required to hand in a hard copy of your presentation at this time 24 hours prior to the start of your lab. Failure to do so will result in an instant 10% deduction. Your group will be given a grade for the quality of your oral presentation. It is important that you; Outline your talk as early as possible Get together to organize and practice the presentation so the timing is accurate and you do not repeat information Remember that your goal is to present material in a clear, succinct and interesting manner. Suggestions for Content and Structure Plan a strong, clear beginning and ending. Provide a clear context for your work. Your introduction should include the objective and biological context of your study. Include your hypotheses and prediction. Present your materials and methods in a simple or streamlined manner. Keep it short and simple. Use the PowerPoint example here to help guide you Helpful presentation pointers for your content Know your audience – think about who you are presenting too. In this case you are reporting your findings to the which every organization is funding your research Reiterate why this research was so important Show your passion for the topic. Every story has a beginning, middle and end. For example, you started with a problem, you sought to answer it and finally you found an “answer”. Keep things simple! Don’t make things so complicated that your audiences lose track of where you are. Keeping it simple will help everyone be able to follow along with you. When needed define abbreviated terms you plan on using. Never assume your audience will know what they mean. Presentation pointers for you Practice over and over and over again until you can flow through the material without any hesitation. This will help ensure you have a handle on the material when you are nervous up at the front of the class. Take the opportunity to practice your presentation in the class Get ready to perform. This is a performance! Know your lines and your subject. Memorizing your lines can be problematic as you may start to sound too scripted. Use bullet points to help tell you what to talk about instead. Remember you are telling a story. In order to help deal with nerves before a presentation work out slowing your breathing, visualize yourself giving a relaxed talk and even tell yourself you are confident. You may even want to “power pose” it! For those that don’t watch Grey’s Anatomy this is when you stand like superman or superwomen right before attempting something that makes you nervous. There are studies indicating this is very successful but at the very least it’s not going to hurt right? Walk confidently to the front of the room to get you in the right frame of mind Stand tall when you are up there and keep your chest lifted. Remember you totally got this! Above all…smile! You will instantly appear more relaxed and research shows that smiling can actually reduce your stress level. Plus, there is the added benefit of people enjoying the interaction more as you don’t look like you are totally miserable up there . Speak up. People want to hear what you have to say so make sure they can. Take your time. For you it’s going to feel like its lasting forever but for your audience you may come across like you just had two coffees and a Redbull. Allow for those “awkward” pauses as for the audience it will actually sound more normal. Talk to the audience and not your screen or cue cards. You should know the information so well that all you need is a quick bullet point to get you talking. Keep to the time frame. This is where giving yourself lots of practice time will help out. Present results clearly and simply. If you choose to present summary tables and graphs, make sure they illustrate only the points you want to make. Be sure to describe the axes before the trends in the data and ensure your figures/tables are large enough to be seen by the students at the back of the room. Compare your results directly with the results of other similar research form the literature Do not restrict yourselves to presenting only your best results. Mention problems you had and how you would avoid them next time as well as sources of variation and error and how these impacted your results.
