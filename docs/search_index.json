Some phytoplankton species, however, produce toxins. These toxin producing algae are becoming more common and showing up in more places worldwide. Some of these toxins will produce neurotoxins that prevent nerve transmission signals, resulting in negative effects in animals that consume it. Toxins from phytoplankton can be transferred through the food web and accumulate in higher trophic levels, causing mortality in shellfish, fish, sea birds, and humans. Humans that eat contaminated shellfish can become sick and die. A major challenge for aquatic scientists and environmental managers is to predict the response of animal populations to the proliferation of toxic phytoplankton. A great deal of scientific effort is spent trying to understand the population dynamics of toxic algal blooms and their effects on the food web. Figure 1. Simplified marine food web, including toxic phytoplankton A vital link between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels is provided by copepods, a type of zooplankton. Zooplankton are animal-like plankton that need to ingest other organisms to survive. Copepods are estimated to be the most abundant animals on the planet and are the main food source for many larval fish species. This leads to the refrain: no copepods no fish. Figure 2. The copepod Acartia hudsonicaand a toxic phytoplankton cell, Alexandrium fundysense. The toxic dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium spp. Often blooms from Long Island Sound in the United Sates, to the Bay of Fundy, Canada (Figure 3). This bloom results in negative effects in animals (grazers) that consume it and these toxins can accumulate in the higher trophic levels, causing mortality in fish, sea birds and humans. In order to better predict the response of animal populations to the proliferation of toxic phytoplankton, Alexandrium fundysense, scientist studied the populations of the copepod Acartia hudsonica found in two different regions of the distribution from the Bay of Fundy, Canada, to about Long Island sound, New York and Connecticut. There are frequent and high toxicity levels in the norther region of this range (e.g., Maine) and no toxic blooms recorded in the southern regions (e.g., New Jersey). Figure 3.Geographical distribution of toxic Alexandrium spp. The frequency and toxicity of Alexandrium decreases from north to south. The copepod Acartia hudsonica, a main grazer of toxic Alexandrium, is found throughout the entire range shown. Stars correspond to population origins from experiments described here. Northern star indicates Maine, southern star indicates New Jersey sampling sites. Scientist discovered that at maximum ingestion rates the Maine population had higher egg production compared to the New Jersey population (Figure 4) however when copepods were ingesting non-toxic phytoplankton there were no differences in egg production between these populations (Figure 5). Figure 4.Ingestion rate (feeding; left) and egg production rate (reproduction; right) for copepods feeding on a diet containing toxic Alexandrium spp. Ingestion rates were measured over a range of food concentrations while egg production rates correspond to a single concentration. Food saturation occurs around 500 µgCL-1; this means that this concentration represents maximum ingestion and egg production. Scientist chose this concentration for egg production because this is where the greatest difference, if any, in ingestion rate occurred. The Maine population (red) had statistically higher ingestion and egg production rate compared to copepods from New Jersey (green). Units for the dependent variable are in micrograms of carbon (µgC; food) and per copepod per day (ingestion and egg production). Error bars represent standard deviation among replicates in egg production; they are omitted for clarity from ingestion rates. Data adapted from Colin and Dam (2007, 2004). Figure 5.Ingestion rate (feeding; left) and egg production rate (reproduction; right) for copepods feeding on a n o-toxic diet. Ingestion rates were measured over a range of food concentrations while egg production rates correspond to a single concentration. Food saturation occurs around 500µgCL-1; this mean as that this concentration represents maximum ingestion and egg production. There were no differences between the Maine (red) and New Jersey (green) populations for both ingestion and egg production rate compared. That is, the two populations fed and reproduced at the same rate. Units and errors bars are the same as Figure 1. Data adapted from Colin and Dam (2007, 2004). There is still much to learn about the fecundity, mortality and growth of copepods in response to toxic algae. Scientist need to better understand the interaction between toxic algae and their grazers and the adaptability of copepods to toxic algae. Understanding these relationships is key to being able to predict and mitigate issues surrounding fish populations. Your Role You have been hired by National Freshwater Copepod Conservation and Fish Restoration agency (NFCCFR) to investigate the impacts of toxic algae on copepod populations. The NFCCFR is interested to know what negative effects, if any, can toxic algae produce in the copepod population in freshwater populations. Due to budget constraints you and your partner will need to conduct this research in lab and provide the NFCCFR with a proposal for approval prior to initiating your research. (The NFCCFR is your TA in case you were wondering). Before you can begin developing your proposal you must first become immersed in your topic. You and your partner will need to source out 5 primary source papers related to this topic. "],["macroinvertebrates-project.html", "Macroinvertebrates Project", " Macroinvertebrates Project Potential changes in macroinvertebrates: Mitigation recommendations needed In Lannisport, a major town located in the city of Westeros, water sampling has been conducted by the Friends of the Turkey River Organization every three weeks from January to June in order to monitor the impacts of the Milford Farm on the Turkey River (Fig. 6). Figure 6. Map of Milford Farm along the Turkey River There is growing concern that the levels in glyphosate and/or bacteria levels may impact the macroinvertebrate population found in the Turkey river. Data shown below on glyphosate levels (Fig. 2) and fecal bacterial levels (Fig. 3) have been collected every three weeks by a water quality sampling team. Figure 7. Glyphosate levels found both upstream and downstream from farm on the Milford property taken every three weeks. Figure 8. Number of fecal coliform bacterial levels per 100 ml sample upstream and downstream the farm on the Milford property taken every 3 weeks. There is serious concern about the impacts of the farm to the water quality of the creek. The growing concern is whether or not these changes in glyphosate or bacteria levels will result in changes to the macroinvertebrate population and thus the trout population. Both macroinvertebrates and fish populations are used to assess river health however as macroinvertebrate populations are a large source for many animals in this ecological system, the Friends of the Mission Creek (FMCO) and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) are currently interested in looking at macroinvertebrates specifically. Your Role You have been hired by the Friends of the Mission Creek Organization (FMCO) and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) to investigate how this happened, what the possible effects are on the aquatic life and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. Due to budget constraints you and your partner will need to conduct this research in lab and provide the FMCO and the NWF with a proposal for approval prior to initiating your research.

"],["invasive-mussles-project.html", "Invasive Mussles Project", " Invasive Mussles Project Invasive Mussel Project – Mitigation Recommendations Needed Both the zebra and quagga mussels have been shown to be extremely destructive in the Great Lakes (NOAA, 2008). Originally from Eastern Europe they were introduced here in Canada through ballast water discharge from ships, first the zebra mussels in the 80’s and then the quaggas in the 90’s. As of late it appears the quagga mussels can outcompete the zebra mussels due to their ability to tolerate colder temperatures, live I soft sediment and have a much longer siphon for feeding. The NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) have been monitoring the issue since the arrival of the quaggas. The map below (Fig. 1) illustrate how quickly the quaggas have dominated the area. Figure 9. Density of Quagga Mussels in Lake Michigan determined in the year 2000, 2005 and 2010 (NOAA, 2008) Food production for native species have been declining since the introduction of these invasive mussels and in particular the shrimp-like organisms called Diporeia as shown in the Figure 1. Figure 10. Density of Diporeia in Lake Michigan in 1994/1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 (NOAA, 2008) Along with increased mussels and decreased Diporeia researchers have seen an increase in the size and number of harmful bottom-dwelling alga in the Great Lakes. One such algal is called Cladophora, which makes its way on to beaches in clumps rendering the beaches unpleasant due to their unsightly and smelly nature and also impact nutrient levels in the water (NOAA, 2008). Figure 11. Phytoplankton production from 1983 to 2008 in the springtime in southern Lake Michigan (NOAA, 2008).) The decline in Diporiea has resulted in some fish changing diet to a less nutrient rich diet in order to survive. As recreational fishing has a huge presence in the Great Lakes the presence of these invasive mussels has taken its toll on the economy (NOAA, 2008). Alongside this, the tourism industry has been impacted due to the less enticing beach quality that has resulted from the Cladophoral blooms (NOAA, 2008). Consequently, the GLERL has hired you to further investigate why and how this relationship is taking place in order to determine what mitigation strategies may be implemented. Your Role You have been hired by the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) to investigate the relationship seen between invasive mussels and the harmful algal blooms. The GLERL is interested to know how these two populations are connected and what mitigation strategies can be implemented to help.

At the very least you should have at least 3 primary source papers you are referring too throughout your proposal. Discuss your ideas with other students (not just your partner). Get a feel for what everyone else is doing and the depth they are working in. Start writing early! Students often make the mistake of starting the night before the proposal is due. This more than not results in poor submissions and thus lower grades. You should expect that you will have at least 3 rounds of revisions before you submit.

All groups will give oral presentations in your regular lab period during the last week of term. Each group will have 10 minutes for their talk followed by a couple of minutes for questions. This is typically the time period allowed at a scientific conference. Each student in the group should participate equally in the presentation. Your presentation must be done using PowerPoint. A computer and projector will be available in the lab. Bring your presentation on a usb. You are also required to hand in a hard copy of your presentation at this time 24 hours prior to the start of your lab. Failure to do so will result in an instant 10% deduction. Your group will be given a grade for the quality of your oral presentation. It is important that you; Outline your talk as early as possible Get together to organize and practice the presentation so the timing is accurate and you do not repeat information Remember that your goal is to present material in a clear, succinct and interesting manner. Suggestions for Content and Structure Plan a strong, clear beginning and ending. Provide a clear context for your work. Your introduction should include the objective and biological context of your study. Include your hypotheses and prediction. Present your materials and methods in a simple or streamlined manner. Keep it short and simple. Use the PowerPoint example here to help guide you Helpful presentation pointers for your content Know your audience – think about who you are presenting too. In this case you are reporting your findings to the which every organization is funding your research Reiterate why this research was so important Show your passion for the topic. Every story has a beginning, middle and end. For example, you started with a problem, you sought to answer it and finally you found an “answer”. Keep things simple! Don’t make things so complicated that your audiences lose track of where you are. Keeping it simple will help everyone be able to follow along with you. When needed define abbreviated terms you plan on using. Never assume your audience will know what they mean. Presentation pointers for you Practice over and over and over again until you can flow through the material without any hesitation. This will help ensure you have a handle on the material when you are nervous up at the front of the class. Take the opportunity to practice your presentation in the class Get ready to perform. This is a performance! Know your lines and your subject. Memorizing your lines can be problematic as you may start to sound too scripted. Use bullet points to help tell you what to talk about instead. Remember you are telling a story. In order to help deal with nerves before a presentation work out slowing your breathing, visualize yourself giving a relaxed talk and even tell yourself you are confident. You may even want to “power pose” it! For those that don’t watch Grey’s Anatomy this is when you stand like superman or superwomen right before attempting something that makes you nervous. There are studies indicating this is very successful but at the very least it’s not going to hurt right? Walk confidently to the front of the room to get you in the right frame of mind Stand tall when you are up there and keep your chest lifted. Remember you totally got this! Above all…smile! You will instantly appear more relaxed and research shows that smiling can actually reduce your stress level. Plus, there is the added benefit of people enjoying the interaction more as you don’t look like you are totally miserable up there . Speak up. People want to hear what you have to say so make sure they can. Take your time. For you it’s going to feel like its lasting forever but for your audience you may come across like you just had two coffees and a Redbull. Allow for those “awkward” pauses as for the audience it will actually sound more normal. Talk to the audience and not your screen or cue cards. You should know the information so well that all you need is a quick bullet point to get you talking. Keep to the time frame. This is where giving yourself lots of practice time will help out. Present results clearly and simply. If you choose to present summary tables and graphs, make sure they illustrate only the points you want to make. Be sure to describe the axes before the trends in the data and ensure your figures/tables are large enough to be seen by the students at the back of the room. Compare your results directly with the results of other similar research form the literature Do not restrict yourselves to presenting only your best results. Mention problems you had and how you would avoid them next time as well as sources of variation and error and how these impacted your results.
